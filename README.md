# Homework-18

For this homework assignment, all of the code was provided for us.  I simply set up an html routes file to load index.html on start.

I also added a service-worker.js file, so that the files would be cached and the application would work offline.  

When I inspect the application tab of the console, I am able to see the static-cache and the data-cache.  The application works when I am offline.  However, I am currently struggling with the application adding the data to the tracker when brought back online.
